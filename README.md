# aninet: Statistical models for Animal Social Networks

The aninet R package is free and open source software for the statistical analysis of animal social network data. It implements several forms of statistical analysis that are not currently implemented in other packages for animal network analysis (e.g. `ANT`, `asnipe`), but works well to add to the functionality of these packages.

# Installation

To install aninet, first install the `devtools` R package. Then, enter the following code:

```
  devtools::install_github("MNWeiss/aninet")
```
Then, to load the package, run:
```
  library(aninet)
```
